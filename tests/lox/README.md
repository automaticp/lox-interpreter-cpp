# Lox language tests

These tests are small scripts written in the lox language itself.

The subdirectory `ci/` contains tests taken directly from the [munificent/craftinginterpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters).

Since there's no error mechanism built into the language, the expected output can be found in the comments of the script files themselves, and must be manually checked by the tester.
